/**
 * Shared worker-thread body-persist core (#958, single source of truth #883):
 * `JSON.stringify` → chunked `createGzip` pipeline → a per-call staging file
 * from `atomic-write.ts`'s {@link stagePathFor} → atomic rename to
 * `stagePath`, returning byte/timing metrics. Both
 * `clients/review-graph/persist-worker.ts` and
 * `clients/project-snapshot-persist-worker.ts` call this so the streamed-gzip
 * write lives in exactly one place; each worker's `parentPort` wiring owns its
 * own request/result envelope and maps a thrown error onto its own `error`
 * field. The chunked generator keeps the whole JSON string off a single giant
 * Buffer (the whole reason the write is on a worker thread — a naïve sync gzip
 * on the main save path regressed host memory by +656MB, per the #950 review).
 *
 * On failure the partial `.tmp` is removed and the error is rethrown for the
 * caller to record; the `stagePath` itself is only ever created by the atomic
 * rename, so a crash mid-write can never leave a torn stage file behind.
 *
 * That crash-safety is NOT the same as concurrency isolation, and this
 * docstring used to conflate the two (#1217). The staging name is what keeps
 * two concurrent calls on one `stagePath` from writing into a shared inode,
 * and it has to come from `stagePathFor` rather than a local
 * `${stagePath}.tmp-${process.pid}`: this module runs on worker threads, which
 * share `process.pid` with the main thread and with each other, so pid alone
 * isolates nothing here (#1205's per-pid tear, verbatim). Callers normally
 * pass a per-generation `stagePath`, which makes the overlap rare — a retry, a
 * re-queued persist, a repeated generation, or a future non-generational
 * caller makes it exact. Beyond tear-freedom this offers nothing: two calls on
 * one `stagePath` are still unordered and last-rename-wins on POSIX — on
 * Windows, MoveFileEx's REPLACE_EXISTING does not serialize concurrent replaces
 * of the same destination, so one rename can fail with EPERM instead, which
 * the caller must treat as a persist failure (both persist workers fall back
 * to a main-thread rewrite on an error result).
