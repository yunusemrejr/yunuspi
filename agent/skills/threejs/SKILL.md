# Three.js

## Scene setup

Check the installed revision and renderer backend before copying examples. Use a single owned animation loop; convert elapsed milliseconds to seconds for motion. Resize the drawing buffer and camera aspect together and call `camera.updateProjectionMatrix()`. Choose pixel ratio from a measured quality/performance budget: DPR 2 costs four times the pixels of DPR 1, but 2 is not a correctness limit. Set a consistent world scale and keep the perspective near plane positive. Push near outward and far inward where composition permits; no fixed ratio guarantees freedom from z-fighting. [Renderer](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/WebGLRenderer.html), [camera](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/PerspectiveCamera.html).

For clip blending, root motion, camera calculations, animated instancing and teardown, use [threejs-animation-engineering](../threejs-animation-engineering/SKILL.md).

## Lighting and color

Standard/Physical materials respond to suitable lights; environment maps are useful for image-based lighting and reflections, especially metals, but are not universally required to avoid black output. Start with deliberate lighting and inspect exposure, normals and material settings. Tone mapping is a scene/display choice, not a requirement for PBR materials. Keep lighting in linear space and output conversion at the end; avoid duplicate conversion in a postprocessing chain. [Standard material](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/MeshStandardMaterial.html), [Color](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/Color.html).

Color maps commonly use `SRGBColorSpace`; normal, roughness and metalness textures carry data and should not undergo sRGB decoding. Black/washed colors can arise from missing illumination, texture annotations, exposure or conversion errors; tone mapping being disabled alone does not establish a defect. [Texture](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/Texture.html).

## Assets

Prefer the project's existing glTF pipeline when appropriate. Draco/Meshopt and KTX2 can reduce transfer or GPU texture costs, with asset-dependent results; no fixed compression ratio or polygon cap fits every scene. Use loaders and decoder versions compatible with the installed Three.js, and call `KTX2Loader.detectSupport(renderer)` when using that loader. [KTX2Loader](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/KTX2Loader.html).

Power-of-two texture requirements depend on the graphics API. WebGL1 restricts NPOT wrapping and mipmapping; do not impose those rules on WebGL2 indiscriminately. Measure decoded texture memory as well as download size. [WebGL texture rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Using_textures_in_WebGL).

## Performance and ownership

Profile CPU work, draw submission, vertex/fragment work and resource counts before choosing an optimization. Merge compatible static geometry or use instancing where appropriate; several materials and passes can still require several draws. Reuse geometry/material/texture resources with explicit ownership. Mark modified instance attributes dirty once per batch and refresh animated bounds. [InstancedMesh](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/InstancedMesh.html).

Removing an object does not release its GPU resources. Release geometries, materials, textures and render targets only after their final consumer is gone; do not traverse arbitrary object values and dispose shared assets blindly. Dispose the renderer only at its owning lifecycle boundary. Routine child unmount does not require forced context loss. Stop loops/listeners and prevent late async loads from attaching after teardown. [Material disposal](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/Material.html), [renderer lifecycle](https://threejs.org/docs/pages/WebGLRenderer.html).

## Shader and defect checks

Use ShaderMaterial/chunks compatible with the renderer revision or the project's existing node/TSL path. Switching to WebGPU is an architectural choice, not a required upgrade for animation. Keep custom color output and vertex deformation consistent across visible, shadow and picking paths.

For black output inspect camera/frustum, lights, normals, loading failures and material. For flicker inspect coplanarity, depth precision and overlapping geometry before applying a scale-independent magic offset. For blur compare CSS and drawing-buffer dimensions. Test the relevant viewport and repeat mount/unmount for lifecycle changes.
