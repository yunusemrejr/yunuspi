  Front-end design — making a browser UI read as one coherent system. The five layers (structure, composition, type, color, motion) and the unifying principle; the finite-set rule (a page's identity is its finiteness: one spacing scale, 3 type roles, 2-3 colors, 1 radius, 2 shadows); layout (containers, the 12-col grid with gutter consistency, section rhythm, whitespace-as-design); type as structure (4 roles, line length/height, pairing); color role assignment (90/10, dark as a system); component specs (button hierarchy, one card spec, input/icon specs); responsive (priority-first, few big jumps, 12→8→4); the emphasis rules (one emphasis per element, vary the kind — the anti-monotony that keeps it from reading as AI); and the self-audits (squint test, the 5-second statement, the remove test). Use when designing or redesigning any web page, when a screen "lacks polish/consistency" and you need the names for why, or as the capstone over the other UI skills (visual-composition, fonts, colors, motion).

# Front-end design (the capstone)

The other UI skills are the organs — `visual-composition` (composition), `fonts` (type), `colors`/`color-theory` (color), `motion` (motion), `design-systems` (scale/consistency), `web-patterns` (shapes). This skill is the *organism*: the discipline that makes a page read as **one system, one voice, one hand**. The failure mode it exists to kill: every part is technically correct and the page still looks *assembled* — the generic "competent" look.

## The principle: identity is finiteness

A coherent page is *finite*: a small, repeated set of decisions that the eye learns. The eye recognizes a system by its **repetition** — the same spacing scale, the same three type roles, the same accent doing the same job everywhere. Incoherence is *excess of exceptions*: a fourth radius here, a new shadow there, a "special" spacing for one section. The test: **could a stranger list your page's set?** (three type sizes, two spacings, one accent usage, one radius) — if the answer is a list, you have a system; if it's "honestly it varies," you have a collage that happens to be polished.

## The five layers, and the one rule per layer

1. **Structure (IA → layout)**: the grid + container + section order carry the *logic*; `web-patterns` owns the shapes, this layer owns the *skeleton*. One container for the page (1200–1440 on marketing; fluid-with-max for apps), one gutter used **everywhere** (gutter consistency is what reads as "coherence" before any other thing), 12 columns collapsing 12→8→4 at the real content breaks (not 12→11→9 — the intermediate column count is the half-jump that reads as "mobile-ish desktop").
2. **Composition**: hierarchy first — `visual-composition`. The rule for the *whole page* (vs. one element): the **one emphasis per screen, one job per emphasis**. The hero gets scale; the CTA gets color; the feature gets whitespace — *never two elements fighting for the same emphasis type in the same view.*
3. **Type (type is structure)**: four roles, each a fixed size+weight. **Display** (the one statement: 48–72, tight 1.1–1.2, the distinctive face), **Heading** (section: 24–32, 1.2–1.3), **Body** (reading: 16–18, **1.5–1.7**, 60–75ch measure), **Label/caption** (metadata: 12–13, the letter-spaced small-caps territory, 0.5–1.5px tracking — tracking only on *short* uppercase, never on body). The pairing: one *distinctive* + one *neutral* (`fonts`); the display's voice is the brand, the body's job is invisible. **Line-height tightens as size grows** (the display at 1.6 is the amateur tell); **the measure is the body's most important number** — the 90ch paragraph is the unreadable-page bug.
4. **Color (roles, not a palette)**: the palette is 90% neutral (the surface/ink scale) + 1 accent that **acts** (links, primary CTA, focus, the one highlight) + the state colors (success/warn/danger — `design-systems`: they mean the same thing on every screen). The **90/10** is structural, not stylistic: the accent *everywhere* is the neon-sign effect (no hierarchy survives). Dark mode is a **system, not an invert** (`color-theory`: the surface/ink elevation model rebuilt, the accent's *luminance* retuned, the pure-black-pure-white kill). If color does two jobs on one screen (accent *and* section-differentiator), the accent has lost its meaning.
5. **Motion**: `motion` — one system of duration/easing (the 200/300/450 trio, the standard ease-out family), the *compositor-only* rule, the reduced-motion *branch*. The page level: one entrance narrative (the page assembles once, on load — then it's *calm*; a page that keeps animating after load is a page that isn't finished).

## Layout: the section rhythm

The page is a **rhythm of densities**, not a stack of boxes: hero (spacious, few elements) → the dense band (the feature grid / the proof) → the spacious band (the statement) → the dense (the CTA block). Alternating density is what makes a long page *read* — five evenly-dense sections are the wallpaper (the eye has no valleys to rest in). The vertical scale: pick **two** section paddings (e.g. 96/128 on desktop, 64/96 mobile) and use only those — the "random 87px" section gap is the un-system tell. The hero's height: **the content decides** (the one-statement + the one-action hero is often *short*; the 100vh-empty hero is the scroll-punishment the user punishes back).

## The components: one spec per class

- **Buttons**: 3 tiers, max. Primary (accent fill — *one per view*, the view's single action), secondary (outline/surface — the alternative), quiet (text/ghost — the tertiary, the inline). One height per tier (the 40/48 desktop / 44 touch minimum — `desktop-ui`), one radius. A fourth tier or a second primary is the hierarchy breaking.
- **Cards**: **one card spec** (radius, border *or* shadow — not both, padding, the internal type roles). Emphasis happens by *content* (an accent bar, an upward-traffic metric) — a "featured card" that gets a *new shadow + a scale + a border* is the decoration stacking (the card does the emphasis that should be the content's). `hover` on cards: the *quiet* one (the 2px lift or the token bg-shift — `motion`), never the gradient-border neon.
- **Inputs**: the spec from `web-patterns` (label, focus ring 2px accent, the error inline). The input's focus ring is where the accent *must* live (the keyboard user's map of the page).
- **Icons**: `svg-assessment` (24-grid, currentColor, one stroke weight, the row-test). The icon set is *one family* — one downloaded-from-elsewhere icon is a fingerprint of the un-system.

## The emphasis rule (the anti-monotony doctrine — this is what keeps it from reading as "AI")

AI-assembled UI is monotone *within* its competence: everything bold-ish, everything equally spaced, one emphasis type (weight or color) for everything, no element that's *quiet*. The human tell is **contrast + variety of emphasis**:

- *Scale contrast*: the page needs at least one display-vs-caption *juxtaposition* (the big number next to its 12px label — the hierarchy is visible *between* them, not in either alone).
- *Variety of emphasis type*: scale for the statement, color for the action, whitespace for the feature, weight for the key phrase — **the same emphasis type twice in the same view is the signal** (two colored elements = two "most important" things; neither is).
- *Quiet is a tool*: the *reduced*-presence element (the 60%-opacity caption, the borderless zone, the unstyled meta) is what makes the loud things loud. The all-60%-or-louder page has no baseline (the value of the accent is defined by the neutrality around it — `colors`' "the neutral *is* the design").
- *Asymmetry over symmetry-by-default*: the centered-hero-everywhere is the template tell; the left-aligned statement with the margin breathing is the editorial answer (`visual-composition`'s asymmetric rule, applied page-wide).

## Responsive: priority-first, few jumps

- *Mobile-first means priority-first*: the mobile layout **decides the content order** (what a thumb needs first survives to desktop as the left/first column) — the desktop-priority-reflowed-down is the "condensed" tell (sections that fight for order at 390px).
- **Three breakpoints, big jumps**: ~640 / ~1024 / ~1440 (or 768/1024/1400). The 6-breakpoint design is the pixel-panic; the jumps are where the *content* changes (the columns 12→8→4, the nav → drawer, the grid 3→2→1), not where a margin feels 4px wrong.
- Nav collapse: content-nav above 768, the drawer below (`web-patterns` bottom-nav for the app-shell cases); the *action* (login, primary CTA) stays visible at every width (the collapsed-nav that hides the only CTA is the mobile conversion bug).
- Touch targets ≥44 everywhere (`desktop-ui` via the web: the 32px web button is the mobile fail); the **hover-state on touch = the active/tap state** (the hover-only info is invisible on touch — `@media (hover: hover)` gates).

## The texture budget (where "premium" lives)

Premium is **restraint with one flourish**, not ornament density. The page budget, max: ≤2 radius values (e.g. 8/16, or 12/full), ≤2 shadow levels (or borders-only — the *all-border, no-shadow* and the *all-shadow, no-border* are both fine; **mixed is the messy one**), ≤1 gradient (and then as a *background* accent, not a text-fill — the gradient-text is the 2023 tell; the gradient-accent-bar is the modern one), ≤1 decorative element per screen (the texture `css-battle`-style, the oversized type, the single illustration). Each flourish *earns the other restraints* by being singular — five flourishes is the casino.

## The self-audits (run before shipping any screen)

1. **The squint test** (the hierarchy survival): squint until the text is gone — can you still see the *order* (what's first, what's second, where the action is)? If the screen is a flat gray field when squinted, the hierarchy is in the *text*, not the *composition* — the design fails with the reading gone.
2. **The 5-second statement** (the communication): five seconds, then answer — what is it, who's it for, what do I do? Three answers from a stranger, pass; one of three, the hierarchy or the copy is failing (`copywriting` + the design are co-responsible — the design can't carry a copy failure and copy can't carry a composition failure; fix the *design* first if the answer is "I don't know what it is," the copy first if it's "I know what it is but not why I'd care").
3. **The remove test** (the restraint check): remove one element (a badge, a border, a third stat, a second button) — if the screen is *better*, it should be gone. The page that survives N removes is the page that's finished at N+1 elements. The AI-assembled page usually *improves* under the remove test — that delta is the excess.
4. **The finiteness test** (the system check): can you list the set in 10 seconds (type roles, spacings, radius, accent jobs)? Yes → system. No → pick the finite set *first*, then apply — the "design" work is mostly the *decision of the set*, the "making" is the application.
5. **The platform-honesty test**: does the web app look like a web app (the native affordances — the text-selection, the right-click, the URL, the tab — `desktop-ui` for the desktop-framed cases) or is it fighting the platform (the fake-titled web app, the mobile-frame on desktop)? The platform-honest UI is the one that never makes the user notice the platform.

## The anti-list (the assembled-tells, the things that say "AI made this" even when every part is correct)

- 5+ type sizes with no named roles (the "it's a scale" without the *roles* is the number-soup).
- Two colored elements in one view (the accent does two jobs — the most common AI failure; `colors`' rule).
- Border + shadow + bg-tint all on the same card (the decoration stack — the "emphasis" is the CSS, not the content).
- Everything centered (the centered-everything is the template; the asymmetry is the hand).
- Equal-weight everything (no display/label *juxtaposition* — the monotone, the remove-test-failer).
- A hero with three CTAs (the view has no opinion — one action per view, the hierarchy rule applied to CTAs).
- The gradient text, the glassmorphism pane with no backdrop reason, the animated blob (the 2022–2024 stock moves — `anti-ai-slop`'s visual tells).
- A "feature grid" of 6 identical cards (the 3×2 of the same-shape = the no-opinion grid; the varied card *sizes* per the content's importance is the editorial answer).
- Mobile: the desktop-priority reflow (the 3-column grid that becomes a 0.5-column soup), the hover-only affordances, the <44px targets.
- The 100vh-empty hero, the 6-breakpoint pixel-panic, the hover-gradient-border neon.
- The *decorative* element with no job (the blob, the gradient, the oversized type that says nothing — every flourish needs a *job* or it's the casino).

The one-line version: **the page is a finite set, applied with rhythm, with one emphasis per view and one job per element; if a stranger could list the set and a squint could see the order, it's designed — if the removes make it better, it isn't finished.**
