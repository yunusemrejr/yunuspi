# Narration and sound

## Writing for the ear

- One idea per sentence, 8–18 words. Put the important word at the end of the sentence, where the voice lands.
- Say what the picture shows, in the order it appears, but add what the picture cannot: why it matters, what it replaced, what happens next.
- Avoid parentheses, lists read aloud, and symbols. Spell out numbers the way they should be spoken ("twenty seventeen", "a hundred million").
- Aim for about 3.3–4.3 syllables per second (roughly 140–170 words per minute for typical prose; short plain words can run faster in wpm while sounding relaxed). Dense technical passages go slower; transitions can go faster. `narration_tts` reports the measured rate per scene.
- Leave breaths: 0.3–0.6 s before a scene's narration starts (`narrationOffset`) and about 0.8 s after it ends before the cut.

## Local narration with Piper

```js
tool_search({ names: ["narration_tts"] })
narration_tts({ action: "install", voice: "en_US-ryan-high" })   // once per machine, checksum-pinned
narration_tts({ action: "synthesize", dir: "my-video", fitScenes: true })
narration_tts({ action: "synthesize", dir: "my-video", scenes: ["intro"], speed: 0.95 })
```

`synthesize` writes `public/audio/narration/<scene>.wav` and records `narrationAudio` and `narrationSeconds` in `video.json`. With `fitScenes: true`, scenes shorter than their narration are lengthened. Cues are scene-relative, so visuals keep their internal timing. Re-time cues to the spoken words afterwards.

Pronunciation: TTS guesses at names and acronyms. Write "G P T" or "transformer" plainly, respell names phonetically ("Vaswani" → "Vas-wah-nee"), and re-synthesize only the affected scenes. Keep the original spelling for on-screen text.

A human recording can replace any scene: put the file in `public/audio/narration/`, set `narrationAudio`, and measure `narrationSeconds` with `media_info`.

## Music bed

`audio_synth kind:"music"` renders a seeded ambient bed sized to the timeline. Direct it:

- `key`/`mode`: minor or dorian for reflective and documentary tones, major for optimistic tones.
- `progression`: four chords, `barsPerChord` 2 for calm, 1 for momentum.
- `bpm` 70–90 under narration. Faster tempos compete with speech.
- `layers`: lower `pulse` and `bell` for dense narration; raise them for visual-only beats.
- `intensity`: automation points `[seconds, 0..1]` that follow the story arc: low in exposition, rising into the key reveal, resolving at the end.

The template ducks music under narration windows automatically (`musicVolume` to `musicDuckedVolume`). Measure the result with `video_qa`; adjust the two volumes in `video.json`.

## Sound accents

`audio_synth kind:"sfx"` with `type` whoosh (object crossing frame, transition), riser (tension into a reveal), impact (reveal lands), tick (items counting or stepping), chime (conclusion, success). Use one accent per idea, place it at the visual event (`video.json` `audio.sfx: [{src, at, volume}]`), and keep it 6–12 dB under narration. If you can't say which visual event a sound belongs to, delete it.

## Captions and sound-driven visuals

Most viewers meet a video muted first. Keep `captions.enabled` on for explainers and social cuts: captions come from the narration text and its measured length, so re-run `narration_tts` after editing a line and the captions follow. Use `karaoke` style for short social pieces where the active word helps pacing, `chunks` for calmer documentary work. The final render writes `captions.srt` and `captions.vtt`; upload them as platform subtitles instead of relying only on burned-in text. Caption timing is estimated from syllables and punctuation, so check two or three chunks against the audio in the preview.

When music carries a section without narration, let the visuals listen: `AudioSpectrum` reads the actual audio file each frame (align it with `offsetSeconds` to where that audio starts). Tie accents to visible events: a `Glitch` or a `KineticText` word landing on the same frame as its sound accent reads as one gesture.

## Loudness targets

| Target | Integrated | Peak |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web and social default | -16 LUFS | ≤ -1 dBFS |
| Platforms that normalize (YouTube) | -14 LUFS | ≤ -1 dBFS |
| Narration-only explainer | narration peaks around -3 to -6 dBFS; music 15–20 LU below the voice | |

Adjust `narrationVolume`, `musicVolume` and `musicDuckedVolume` in `video.json`, re-render, and measure with `video_qa`. For standalone audio deliverables, `media_edit action:"normalize"` does measured two-pass loudness normalization.
